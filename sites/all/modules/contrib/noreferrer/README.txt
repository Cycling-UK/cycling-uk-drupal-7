NO REFERRER
===========

The rel="noreferrer" link type[1] indicates that no referrer information is to
be leaked when following the link. It enhances privacy by allowing users to
avoid leaking referrer information when they click on (or prefetch) links to
external sites. It also enhances security by preventing the linked page from
gaining access to the linking page via the window.opener object.

This module adds a rel="noreferrer" link type to all external links generated by
code (e.g. menu module). It also adds the rel="noopener" link type[2] to links
with a target. You can toggle both link types on and off if, for example, you
want only the security protections of rel="noopener" without the privacy
protections of rel="noreferrer".

This module also provides a filter which, if enabled for a text format, adds the
rel="noopener" and rel="noreferrer" link types to links in user-generated
content. You will probably want to enable the 'Add rel="noopener" and/or
rel="noreferrer" to links' filter on all of your text formats.

Allowed domains can be defined, to which referrer URLs will be sent. If
desired, you may also publish your list of allowed domains as a JSON file,
to which other sites can subscribe. Alternately, you may subscribe to another
site's list of allowed domains.

If metatag module[3] is installed, you may also want to enable the meta referrer
element[4] to set a referrer policy[5] for the page.
