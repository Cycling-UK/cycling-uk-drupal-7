		<h2>Why one of our members joined us</h2>
		<blockquote>
			<p>Because I ride a bike. I don’t tour, not now. I did in my youth, 30 years ago. I ride for pleasure. I ride a mountain bike. I ride to work. I ride for work. It seemed to be the organisation to support. I was a member in my youth when I was cycle touring. I rejoined five years ago when I came back to cycling.</p>
